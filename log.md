**Completion Date:** 21.11.2020

**Learned:** Today I have learned how to use range function. I noted that I need to wrap range in list function to be able to print it. I also discovered that I can
produce a range in descending order by using a negative number as step. I have also created a simple program to check if a given number is divisible by another with range function. It creates a range of numbers starting at a given value and incrementing by this number until 10000000. If a number in question is in a given range then it means that it is divisible.
